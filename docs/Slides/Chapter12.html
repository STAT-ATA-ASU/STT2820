# Experiments and Observational Studies

---
# Observational Studies-researchers don't assign choices, they observe them.

--

1. Retrospective---look back at past choices

--

2. Prospective---identify subjects and follow them through time.

---

# Experiments and vocabulary

An **experiment** is the application of treatments to randomly assigned subjects and the comparison of outcomes.

--

In experiments, our explanatory variables are called **factors** and the outcomes are measured by **response variables**.  The different values a factor can have are called **levels**.  **levels `\(\times\)` levels = total treatments**.

--

**Subject** or **participants** are people on whom an experiment is performed.  **Experimental units** are non-people on whom an experiment is performed, say rats, petri dishes, test tubes, etc.

# The Four Principles of Experimental Design
---
# The Four Principles of Experimental Design

1. Control - make conditions as similar as possible for all treatment groups (control variation)

--

2. Randomize - equalize effects of unknown or uncontrollable variation (reduce bias &amp; combat systematic error)

--

3. Replicate - apply treatment to multiple individuals, apply treatment at different times, locations, etc. (if something works on only one person, it is a story, not data)

--

4. Block - group similar individuals and randomize their group (removes identifiable variation)

# Good Experiments

---
# The best experiments are:

--

1. Randomized

--

2. Comparative

--

3. Double-blind

--

4. Placebo-controlled

--

**Double blind** means that neither the subject nor the person applying the treatment know which treatment is being received.  A **placebo** is a treatment that should not have an effect (like a sugar pill to cure cancer)

---

# Example 12.1  

You have 60 female volunteers who are willing to try anything to get rid of a headache.  You want to test two pain medicines at 500 and 1000 mg doses.  You also want to know whether resting or activity is more helpful is ending pain.  Design a completely randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment.

---

# Solution

* Factors: Medicine and Rest

--

* Medicine has three levels (placebo pill, 500mg, and 1000mg), Rest has two levels (rest, no rest)

--

* Treatments:  there are 3 `\(\times\)` 2 = 6 treatments.

--

* 10 women are randomly assigned to each treatment.

--

* All pills look the same, one person puts the pills into vials 1-30 and 31-60 with 10 of each kind

--

* Subjects are randomly assigned numbers.

--

* 1-30 rest, 31-60 no rest

--

* Compare headache relief after 2 hours.

# Interpretation Issues

---

* A **lurking** variable is typically found in an observational study.

--

* **Confounding** is a problem when the effects of different treatments can't be separated.  Confounding is typically a problem for experiments.

--

* **Statistically significant** means not random.  We have a statistically significant result when differences are too large to be explained by natural variation.
